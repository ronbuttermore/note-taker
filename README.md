# Note Taker

## Description
This web application was developed in order to give busy people a way to organize tasks and notes that they need to save and reference later. The saved notes are stored in a database and can be deleted when completed or no longer needed.

## Usage
To save notes, type in a note title and a body into the text fields displayed. When ready to save, click on the save icon at the top right of the screen. To start a new note, click on the plus icon at the top right of the screen. In order to view saved notes, simply click on them on the left-hand side when saved notes are displayed. To erase a note, click on the red trash icon at the right of the note in the sidebar.
